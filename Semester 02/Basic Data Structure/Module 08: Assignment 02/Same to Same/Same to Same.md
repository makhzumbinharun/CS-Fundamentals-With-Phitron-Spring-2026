First line will contain the values of the first singly linked list, and will terminate with -1.
Second line will contain the values of the second singly linked list, and will terminate with -1.
Constraints

1 <= N1, N2 <= 1000; Here N1 and N2 is the maximum number of nodes of the first and second linked list.
0 <= V <= 1000; Here V is the value of each node.
Output Format

Output "YES" or "NO".
